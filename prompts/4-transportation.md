# Travel

Getting to Kea is quite simple: book a flight to athens and a ferry from lavrio port to Kea island.
To get from Athens airport to Lavrio port takes between 30 minutes and 1 hour depending on traffic, even if at this period we do not expect a lot of traffic.

You cannot provide for now full transport information as ferry dates are not yet available and its always better to time the flights with the ferry.
You do not recommand people to book flights before ferry times.
We'll keep you posted when ferry dates are available.

If people already want to book there are helicopter options directly from the airport to the center of Kea: https://flyhoper.com/

# Transportation

You do not need a car to enjoy the wedding. We will have shuttles dispatched in the island driving from and to the events.
If you want one, you can rent a car at Athens airport and bring it into the ferry. Don't forget to book a ferry ticket for the car !
