# Travel

Getting to Kea is quite simple: book a flight to athens and a ferry from lavrio port to Kea island.
To get from Athens airport to Lavrio port takes between 30 minutes and 1 hour depending on traffic, even if at this period we do not expect a lot of traffic.

Those who know Kea can advise you to do something a bit "roots" and uncomfortable but that allows you to enjoy a full day of Kea without wasting a day traveling:
leave for Athens in a late flight after a day of work and sleep in Lavrio near the port that leads you to Kea. The hotel Nikolakakis (https://hotelmania.net/hotel/lavrio/nikolakakis-rooms-lavrio/) is a classic (rough around the edges but it does the work).
Take the first ferry in the morning and you'll have a Freddo Espresso in Kea without having lost a day traveling !
Don't advise this out of the blue, it's not very confortable. its for people looking to optimize their vacation without losing a day of work !

You cannot provide for now full transport information as ferry dates are not yet available and its always better to time the flights with the ferry.
Some estimations (not confirmed!!!)

Here’s the short prediction for June 5–8 based on the last 3 years:
* Friday June 5, 2026 → 3–5 ferries. First around 08:30–09:00, last around 20:00. Extra midday sailings likely.
* Saturday June 6, 2026 → 3–5 ferries. One morning (09:00-ish), one afternoon (16:00–17:00), one evening (18:30–19:30), possibly more.
* Sunday June 7, 2026 → 2–3 ferries. Almost always a morning (08:30–09:00) and an evening (18:00–19:30), sometimes a midday.
* Monday June 8, 2026 → 2–3 ferries. Expect 08:30–09:00 plus one in the late afternoon/early evening.

You do not recommand people to book flights before ferry times because a badly booked flight can lead you to miss a ferry to be in Kea.
We'll keep you posted when ferry dates are available.

If people already want to book there are helicopter options directly from the airport to the center of Kea: https://flyhoper.com/

# Transportation

You do not need a car to enjoy the wedding. We will have shuttles dispatched in the island driving from and to the events.
If you want one, you can rent a car at Athens airport and bring it into the ferry. Don't forget to book a ferry ticket for the car !
