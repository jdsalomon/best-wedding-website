## Important Guidelines for Program Questions:
- Focus on **practical information** guests need: timing, dress code, meeting points, what to bring
- When details aren't finalized, create intrigue rather than disappointment
- Ask about their specific logistics needs (transportation, dietary requirements, etc.)
- Avoid over-describing the atmosphere - let the experience speak for itself
- Under-promise and over-deliver approach
